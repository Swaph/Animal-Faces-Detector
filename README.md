# Animal Face Detector

**Animal Face Detector** is a machine learning project focused on detecting and classifying animal faces from a given dataset. The project involves data acquisition from Kaggle, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This project is a practical implementation of computer vision techniques in Python using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The **Animal Face Detector** project aims to build a robust model capable of identifying various animal faces in images. The project follows a structured workflow, including:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Downloading the Animal Faces dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preparation:** Preprocessing the images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
3. **Model Training:** Training a deep learning model to detect and classify animal faces.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
- **Dataset Source:** The Animal Faces dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- **Data Unzipping:** The dataset is unzipped into the appropriate directory for further processing.
- **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model performance.

### 2. Model Training
